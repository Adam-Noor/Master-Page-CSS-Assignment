    After the tea was destroyed, Britain punished Massachusetts with harsh laws, which made tensions worse.
    Instead of calming things down, the reaction pushed more colonies to cooperate and coordinate their response.
    Many colonists saw the punishment as proof that Britain would restrict colonial rights to maintain control.

    These events helped unite the colonies and increased support for shared political action.
    Meetings and congresses became more common as leaders discussed how to resist and protect colonial interests.
    Over time, this growing unity contributed to the conflicts that became the American Revolution.
