  <p>
    The Boston Tea Party was a protest that happened on December 16, 1773, when colonists in Boston dumped tea into the harbor to resist British taxes.
    Many of these colonists were part of the Sons of Liberty, a group known for organizing resistance to British policies.
    They boarded three ships—the Dartmouth, the Eleanor, and the Beaver—and threw hundreds of chests of tea into the water to reject British control and taxation.

    The event was carefully planned. Many participants disguised themselves as Mohawk Indians to hide their identities and to show they were acting as “Americans,” not loyal British subjects.
    Other cargo aboard the ships was left untouched, highlighting that the tea itself was the symbol of protest.
    The Boston Tea Party became one of the most famous events leading up to the American Revolution.
